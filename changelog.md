# Changelog! What's new in the Add-On

## Power Sequencer 1.2 (üë∑üèΩ Work in Progress) ##

*These are the features and fixes we added lately, and that'll be in the next major update.*

You can test them by going to the Blender preferences, add-ons tab, Power Sequencer, and by clicking `Install latest master / old version`. You can go back to the stable version with the same button.

‚ö† This is a Work in Progress. Even if we're careful, new features can have bugs üêõ

### üìò Free Tutorials ###

Learn to use BPSrender from the command line! We still need people to tell us that it works well everywhere before we can integrate it in Blender. Also, we need your help to design a nice render panel üòÑ

- [Precise and Fast selections with Blender's Sequencer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewwFVsNCBNg)

*Note: if you [install bpsrender with pip](https://pypi.org/project/bpsrender/), you can call bpsrender directly like so: `bpsrender blender_file_path [options]`, instead of typing `python -m bpsrender ...`*

### üíª User Interface

Thanks to @aditiapratama and @libreartist, we now have a nice **toolbar menu**! It will show you most available tools and keyboard shortcuts.

### üé•üï∫ New features ###

- **Remove crossfade**: Remove crossfades in a clean way, as you'd expect! If you select one or more transition effects like Crossfade or Wipe, pressing <kbd>X</kbd> will now bring the sequences back together to form a precise cut.
- **Remove Gaps and ignore locked strips**: Blender's default tool to remove gap isn't very smart. We had to code our own to create the feature below...
- **Cut with the mouse, without touching locked strips**: edit to music with the add-on's fast mouse-based tools! Lock your audio strip and you're good to go üòÉ
- **Select related strips**: find and select effects related to the selection, to then cut, copy or duplicate a strip with everything that should come with it.
- **Space strips based on mouse position**: this is bound to the <kbd>=</kbd> key by default

#### BPSProxies ####

The proxy render script got serious love in this version.

- Thanks to Fran√ßois Grassard, a TV engineer, we now have **super efficient proxy rendering** presets! These proxies are designed to be easy on Blender, and they offer way smoother preview than Blender's ones üòÉ. They also generate way faster
- You can now use convenient presets to render proxies, thanks to [@jooert](https://github.com/jooert). Use the `--preset` or `-p` option followed by the preset's name. This version ships with the `mp4`, `webm`, and `nvenc` presets
    - Nvenc is Nvidia's solution to encode MP4 with your graphics card. It requires ffmpeg 4, an nvidia GPU that supports Nvenc encoding, and I'm not sure this is available on linux! But it will work on Windows. It's especially fast with 50% and 100% sized proxies. The rendering speed difference isn't as big with 25% proxies.
- You can now **render 25%, 50%, and 100% proxies**! The default size is still 25%. use the `--size` option (`-s` in short form) when calling the program from the command line. E.g. `-s 50` to generate 50% proxies
- The code is better organized now, easier to read and to contribute to in the future. Thanks [@sudopluto](https://github.com/sudopluto) for making this possible üôÇ

#### Meta strips ####

- **Resize to content**: if you edit inside a group or meta strip, you may want to trim it to use it as a compositing group. Now you can! Works on all selected strips at once.
- **UnMeta many strips**: <kbd>Alt</kbd> <kbd>G</kbd> now works on all selected meta strips at once
- **Auto-trim** your nested timelines when you UnMeta strips: also works by default with <kbd>Alt</kbd> <kbd>G</kbd>. If you don't want this to happen, use Resize to Content first

#### Scenes ####

- **Convert selection to scene strip**: If you want to use the node compositor to do complex grade, or to help organize your project, you'll want to use scene strips at times, instead of meta strips.

### ‚úÖ Improvements ###

- Auto crossfades (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Alt</kbd> <kbd>C</kbd>) now work in a **single channel by default**, as in every other professional video editing program
  - You can also **add multiple crossfades** at a time, e.g. to create an image slideshow with fades between each picture
  - This makes it a lot easier to export Blender edits to Davinci Resolve, Premiere, or Final Cut with the [EDL export add-on](https://github.com/tin2tin/ExportEDL)
- Grab closest cut (<kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>Alt</kbd> <kbd>G</kbd>) now supports linked strips! It's the fastest way to select and transform the strips' handles on either side of a cut.
- Delete direct now automatically **deletes the strip under the mouse cursor** if there's nothing selected.
- **Swap strips vertically**: You can now conveniently change the order of effects or linked strips, e.g. picture overlays
- Smartly remove strips: if you press X but don't have anything selected, Power Sequencer will find and delete the strips under the mouse cursor for you!
- Jump in time with <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>‚û°</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>‚¨Ö</kbd>: It's consistent with <kbd>‚¨Ö</kbd> and <kbd>‚û°</kbd> to move 1 frame on the timeline. This new tool works in seconds so the jump will be the same regardless of your project's framerate!
- **Concatenate in multiple channels at a time**, and concatenate linked strips! The concatenate tool got a rewrite to make better decisions based on your selection
- **Concatenate towards the right**: Press <kbd>Alt</kbd> <kbd>C</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>Alt</kbd> <kbd>C</kbd> to respectively concatenate the previous strip towards the next one, or concatenate all strips before the selected towards the right.
- **Auto-selection**: If you don't have anything selected, Power Sequencer will use the strip under the cursor for concatenate, delete, and grab operators, saving your extra keystrokes and time üòÑ
- **Edit crossfades with the grab tool**: grab became smarter. If you only select cross effects, it G will select the handles on either side of the crossfade instead of trying to move it directly.

#### Improvements to the source code ####

We've reorganized and simplified many features, to make it easier for you to read and to contribute! Now, all marker-related features, fade-related features, etc. are grouped together.

### ü§ï Fixes ###

- Removed the option to swap strips with effects, as they were causing problems
- Fixed errors when adding crossfades, that could happen with different starting selections
- The add-on will now only load necessary files in Blender, making startup a little faster
- Fixed an error when trying to delete (<kbd>X</kbd>) without a selection
- BPSrender got a few fixes:
  - If you set your render to the /tmp\ folder, BPSrender wouldn't work. It now reads your render settings instead to properly set the render path
  - Render now works as expected when there's whitespace in the file paths
- Proxies rendered with BPSProxies should now be in sync with the original footage: the previous settings we used caused offsets in rare cases
- Fixed errors when trying to delete strips
- Fixed Concatenate not taking in account the selection if more than one strip is selected in a given channel
- Fixed strips changing channels when using Snap Selection to Cursor

## Power Sequencer 1.1: Faster edits üéû‚úÇ ##

üìÖ Released in August 2018

*Huge thanks to all the contributors who made this release possible: @doakey3 and @sudopluto, @razcore-art, @jooert, and @Blezyn, who recently joined the adventure üòä. Thanks to them this new version brings many new features and improvements to the add-on!*

### Free tutorials ###

**Two new tutorials** came out to complement the project. They are about Python programming, to help more people create their own tools and contribute to existing add-ons:

- [Learn to Code Blender Features in Python: Add-On Programming Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_Jo9NShkP8)
- [Auto-Completion for Blender Python in Any Code Editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQgLBnPO2uo)

### üé•üï∫ New features ###

- **Multithreaded rendering** with BPSRender: use this command line tool to leverage all your CPU cores! Works on all platforms and available as a stand-alone program. ‚ö† Only tested on Ubuntu and Windows 10! *Known issues: on Windows, you will sometimes need to close Blender instances manually with the task manager if you interrupt the render.*

- **Unspeed**: remove a speed effect from a video sequence
- **Clear fades**: remove fade animation cleanly on selected sequences
- **Deselect strips** to the left or right of the time cursor
- **Swap two strips**: works across channels and not just to the left or the right of the selected strip, unlike Blender's built-in tool
- **Markers as time codes**: write a list of timecodes followed by the markers' names to create quick links in your YouTube video description or comments
- **Markers from selected strips**: Create a new marker at the start of each strip in the selection
- **Match strips to markers**: snap selected strips to markers that have a similar name

### ‚úÖ Improvements ###

*Existing features got some love as well!*

- **Multithreaded proxies** now shows a percentage-based progress for each video being rendered
- **Multithreaded proxies**: supports calling presets from the command line. More work planned for version 1.2
- Many small improvements happened to exsting features, e.g. to automatically select strip near the mouse cursor if nothing is selected.

### ü§ï Fixes ###

**Restored the missing interface** code so you can call the contextual Power Sequencer menu again, nd find the power sequencer tab i the and menu. we need help to design the UI: we have a developer who wants to work on it, but we need a UX designer to guide him!

Reply to [this issue](https://github.com/GDquest/Blender-power-sequencer/issues/90) and [that issue](https://github.com/GDquest/Blender-power-sequencer/issues/89) if you want to help us wit it üòÑ

### ‚ö† Experimental ###

- **Auto align audio and video**: this tool for tech-savy people, currently not available in blender
- **Batch transcode videos**: transcode selected videos to the same frame rate from blender! Uses FFMPEG. More work planned for version 1.2
- **Trim in and and out points**: trim the left or the right of the strip closest to the mouse, using the time cursor. No shortcut assigned by default: you'll have to create shortcut entries manually for `power_sequencer.trim_three_point_edit`
