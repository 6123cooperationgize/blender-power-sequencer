Blender's video sequencer has a lot of potential, but it lacks essential tools for content creators to edit videos efficiently.

I made [hundreds of tutorials](http://youtube.com/c/gdquest) over the years. After working with popular yet unstable professional programs like Vegas and Resolve, I now **work exclusively with Blender**. It does have some limitations, but it's the most stable and versatile tool you'll find out there.

I built these tools to edit tutorials as fast as possible. They're getting better month after month, and they're yours for Free.

## Features

<p align='center'>

</p>

1. **Instant import**: finds and imports all new videos, images and sound files in your project folder
1. Render HD videos for Youtube, Twitter and Facebook in one keyboard shortcuts: Power Sequencer sets all the rendering parameters for you
1. **Cut, trim and edit faster than ever** in Blender with smart mouse-based tools
1. Instant fades and crossfades
1. Build **better proxies** with FFmpeg, using a Python script in the `utils/` folder
1. And much more

*To find all available tools, press <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> and search for 'PS.' (as in PowerSequencer).*

## 1.0 alpha


To install the add-on, head to the [latest releases](https://github.com/GDquest/Blender-power-sequencer/releases) and follow the instructions there.

It is fairly stable already as I use it every single day for [ GDquest ](http://youtube.com/c/gdquest). But as there are still features in progress for 1.0, it's currently out in 'alpha'. It also ships with a separate keymap file so the many custom shortcuts won't override your existing custom mappings.

## Give us a hand!

We're already working together with [ Davide Cristi ](https://github.com/davcri) to help more people create videos with Blender. This add-on is a living, open project, and we'd be glad to welcome new contributors! We need people to:

- Code new features
- Improve existing features
- Help solidify the code
- Write mini-tutorials on the [ docs repository ](https://github.com/GDquest/Blender-power-sequencer-docs/)

There's a convenient list of [Good first issues](https://github.com/GDquest/Blender-power-sequencer/labels/good%20first%20issue) to help you get started. I'm also available to help you navigate the code or if you have questions about the project.

## Learn video editing with Power Sequencer and Blender

The docs are in progress. Until the dedicated website is ready, you can find them on the [ power-sequencer-docs repository ](https://github.com/GDquest/Blender-power-sequencer-docs/). There's also a growing list of [ Free video tutorials ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhqJJNjsQ7KFjp88Cu57Zb9_wFt7nlkEI) on Youtube (*14 videos at the time of writing*).

These are not classical docs: on top of Power Sequencer's features, we're looking to help you improve your understanding of Blender's video editing tools too!


## Other add-ons

Here are other recommended add-ons for a better editing workflow:

1. [VSE transform tools](https://github.com/kgeogeo/VSE_Transform_Tools): Move and animate transform effects visually, on the image preview area. The addon auto-registers shortcuts, especially the <kbd>T</kbd> key, to add a Transform effect to selected sequences.
2. [Easy logging](http://www.easy-logging.net/): Adds tools to derush and tag footage.
