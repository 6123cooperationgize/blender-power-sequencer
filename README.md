Power Sequencer brings smart new editing features to edit faster with Blender's Video Sequence Editor. It is completely Free and Open Source.

## Installation guide ##

1.  Download the repository. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/GDquest/Blender-power-sequencer/releases) for a stable version, or click the green button above to get the most recent (and potentially unstable) version.
2.  Open Blender
3.  Go to File > User Preferences > Addons
4.  Click "Install From File", navigate to the downloaded .zip file, and install
5.  Activate the checkbox next to "VSE: Power Sequencer"

Blender 2.80 saves your settings automatically by default.

## Other add-ons ##

Here are other recommended add-ons for a better editing workflow:

Daniel Oakey's [rewrite of VSE Transform Tools](https://github.com/doakey3/VSE_Transform_Tools). This tool lets you animate and move strips from the video preview. The original add-on was abandoned a few years ago. Daniel fixed and rewrote it so now it's super slick!

Power Sequencer ships with two separate Python tools:

1. [BPSRender](https://github.com/GDquest/BPSRender), a tool to render videos with multiple threads from the terminal
1. [BPSProxy](https://github.com/GDquest/BPSProxy), a program to render proxies fast using FFmpeg and, if your graphics card supports it, use hardware acceleration
