Other add-ons
-------------

Here are other recommended add-ons for a better editing workflow:

Daniel Oakey's [rewrite of VSE Transform Tools](https://github.com/doakey3/VSE_Transform_Tools). This tool lets you animate and move strips from the video preview. The original add-on was abandoned a few years ago. Daniel fixed and rewrote it so now it's super slick!
