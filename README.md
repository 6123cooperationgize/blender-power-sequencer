Video editing add-on for Blender

Blender's video editor has a lot of potential, but it lacks some essential tools for content creators. I produced [hundreds of tutorials](http://youtube.com/c/gdquest) since 2015, and work exclusively with Blender.

Here are the tools I built to edit tutorials faster.

## Heavy Work in Progress

The tools themselves work, but the add-on is not documented yet, and not ready for everyone to use. You'll have to assign the operators to shortcuts by yourself, or you could use [this keymap](https://gist.github.com/NathanLovato/84b3a8529e5757875c8e97f4d7b424f4).
